# Hello Everyone!

This is the y2 incubator meet startup project tackling the problem of "Haredi Stigma & Integration"
This project will be a simple social networking site to help connect the community and integrate them further into their society. Consisting of several pages and systems this project hopes to have similar features to popular social media sites with friends, profiles, and more!

# Current Status

- Test systems with a few pages and a temporary styling
- Created a basic chatbot (still needs more bug testing and polishing)
- Currently working on implementing the base website using our new design and working on the systems themselves such as the chatting, adding friends and more.

## Downloading and trying out the website

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
